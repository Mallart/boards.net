# boards.net
Is an open source forum and chatting app.
It's designed to be fast, reliable, secure, and guarantees anonimity.

## The App

### Be anonymous

### Chat fast
The backend is written in C++ 11, so every communication is fast and reliable.

I decided not to rely on PHP for this project, as I heard and saw many security vulnerabilities using PHP.

## The backend
The first thing being developed is the backend.
We're using the concept of REST APIs to work with the database. That way, the client is independant from the backend.

### HTML Generation
Boards.net supports basic HTML generation from the backend. That way, webpages can be generated on the fly to answer client queries.

### JSON Generation
Boards.net also supports JSON generation to answer API calls.

### Security and cryptography
Boards.net works intensively on security, anonimity and reliability. That way, we make sure it can be a safe lpace for everyone to share content.
