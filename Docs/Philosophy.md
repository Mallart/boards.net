# Boards.net philosophy
Boards is a network made to connect people, and for everyone to chat freely.
That way, we make sure every account on the platform is a whole identity linked in no way to your real person.

## Being anonymous is a right
We believe that every person deserves the right to be anonymous, and to link only the data they want with their online identity.

### How Boards will use your data
Actually, we probably won't at all. We only use your IP address to communicate with your device using the TCP/HTTP protocol (yeah, that's called loading a web page and sending back data to a server... We can't really communicate with you if we don't have your IP actually. And you communicate with the server's IP too, so we don't think that's a big deal).
But each time we collect your data, that's because you asked for it (maybe you wanted to enable a security option, or to link your email address with your account).
Otherwise, we won't collect any data you send us unknowingly.
