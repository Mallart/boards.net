# Boards.net security
We wanna make sure Boards.net is a safe place to exchange informations, and we have several goals to achieve in order to create that safe place we wish you will use;
## Alternative online identity
To make your privacy always stronger and your digital footprint more thin, we make in our databases an alternate identity, never linking any real data you emit to your account (except if you tell us to do so).
We'll generate a passphrase for you, that will be your identity and password.
Your account ID will be a random generated hash and you'll actually never have to use it, except when you wanna communicate with other members.
